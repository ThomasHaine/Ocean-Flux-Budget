# Ocean-Flux-Budget

Pedagogical tool to compute ocean fluxes of mass, heat, salt, and freshwater through a sequence of hypothetical hydrographic sections. 
The sections are based on the Arctic Ocean gateways at Fram, Davis, Bering Straits, and the Barents Sea Opening.
The tool also computes budgets of mass, heat, salt, and freshwater.
