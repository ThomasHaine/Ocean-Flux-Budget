# Ocean-Flux-Budget

Pedagogical tool to compute ocean fluxes of mass, heat, salt, and freshwater through a sequence of hypothetical hydrographic sections. 
The sections are based on the Arctic Ocean gateways at Fram, Davis, Bering Straits, and the Barents Sea Opening.
The tool also computes budgets of mass, heat, salt, and freshwater.

Clone the repo using the `MATLAB->Project->New->From Git` sequence. 

Or install the standalone MacOs executable from `OceanFluxBudget_standalone/for_redistribution/MyAppInstaller_web`.

If you want a standalone executable for a different operating system (Linux, Windows), raise an issue.

Theory notes are in the `WriteUp/budgets_theory.pdf` document. This includes suggestions for best practices!

Comments welcome!  (raise an issue, send email)
